Presentation
------------------

IdeaLoom is an Open Source application that enables hundreds or even thousands of people to work together effectively on the definition of new ideas. The application supports the belief that with the proper conditions, people working together can think smarter than any one member of the group could alone. Traditional collective intelligence software tends to refine ideas from one person. IdeaLoom is different. It focuses on co-building new ideas.

IdeaLoom is made with the following technologies :

- HTML5, [MarionetteJS](http://marionettejs.com/)
- [Nginx](http://nginx.org/)
- [The Pyramid Framework](http://www.pylonsproject.org/)
- [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
- [Postgres](http://postgresql.org)

IdeaLoom is tested on multiple browsers using [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com)

IdeaLoom is developed by [Conversence](http://www.conversence.com) and is based on Assembl by [bluenove](http://assembl.bluenove.com)

Installation is described in [INSTALL](https://github.com/conversence/idealoom/blob/develop/doc/INSTALL.rst)
